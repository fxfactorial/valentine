valentine
===========

**valentine** is a statically linked binary that validates your HTML
against the offical W3C HTML spec. Syntax is checked, but only some of
the semantic properties. In case of error, valentine gives you the file
name, line number, column number, offending text, and issue.

Install it with `opam`, the OCaml package manager, with 

```shell
$ opam install valentine
```

If there is an error then valentine will exit with exit code 1 making
it very easy use in your shell scripts.

Example output
=================

```shell
$ valentine test.html
File:test.html line 4, column 1: misnested tag: 'body' in 'body'
File:test.html line 4, column 10: unmatched start tag 'em'
File:test.html line 5, column 14: bad token '>' in tag: expected attribute value after '='
File:test.html line 4, column 10: unmatched start tag 'em'
```
